An AI-powered web application that detects whether a chess game is played by a **human or a bot** using machine learning and gameplay behavior analysis.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rapid rise of online chess platforms, automated bots can disrupt fair play. This project solves that problem by analyzing **real chess match data** and identifying suspicious bot-like behavior using machine learning models.

The system extracts **15+ gameplay features** such as:
- Move timing patterns
- Accuracy
- Blunder frequency
- Game consistency
- Player performance trends

Using these features, the model predicts whether the game was played by a **human or a bot** with up to **87% accuracy**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier ✅
- Decision Tree Classifier ✅

The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and deployed for real-time predictions.

---

## 🌐 Web Application

The trained model is deployed using **Flask** and hosted online. Users can:
- Upload match details
- Submit gameplay features
- Instantly receive bot/human predictions

This makes the system practical, fast, and easy to use.
